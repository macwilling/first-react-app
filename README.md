# Household Tracker App

My first attempt at a react app. Trying to build an app to keep track of things I need to get done around the house and other things we need to track, including:
**Phase 1**

- Regular Chores
- Home Maintenance
- Auto Maintenance

**Phase 2**

- Meal Planner
- Recipe storage
- Shopping list

**Phase 4**

- Push notifications

**Phase 3**

- Family calendar
- Shopping list generator from recipes

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
